        <p>
            Roller coaster amusement rides have origins back to ice slides constructed in 18th-century Russia. Early
            technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports.
            The technology evolved in the 19th century to feature railroad track using wheeled cars that were securely
            locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and
            underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century,
            these elements intensified with the introduction of steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to
            invert riders.
